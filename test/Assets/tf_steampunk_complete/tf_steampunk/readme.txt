Thank you for downloading this Time Fantasy asset pack.

This set includes tilesets for a STEAMPUNK setting. It includes:
 - city buildings in the style of the industrial revolution (three color variations)
 - steam trains (outside and inside)
 - Victorian-inspired interiors
 - dungeons full of pipes, valves, and clockwork mechanisms
 - and many more additional object tiles
 - Also: animated smoke and steam effects and animated gears

Note: This release also includes the Sewer tileset as a free bonus (in a separate folder).

-------------------------

This set is an expansion for the Time Fantasy RPG assets. It's compatible with all other graphics that I release in my Time Fantasy style (particularly the "Future Fantasy" set, which includes similarly-themed city and factory tiles).

Included are versions formatted for use in RPGMaker VX/Ace and RPGMaker MV, as well as a regular tile-sheet based on a 16x16 grid.
